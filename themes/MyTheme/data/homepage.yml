    Hello! My name is Yassine Oujaa and I enjoy solving problems using my keyboard .
    I love spending a lot of time coding. My interest in software engineering started back in 2018
    when I had an idea about society related problem and I wanted to develop it.

    <br/> <br/>
    Fast-forward to today, and I have had the privilege of working on different projects

    I love working on group and I enjoy every moment of that , I love linux and specially Arch distribution
    I worked with different programming languages such as Java , C/C++ , Python , JavaScript , PHP and more .
